# 6174
This software is used to prove and/or determine the parameters where the 6174 conjecture is true and to determine if there are similar numbers for different numbers of digits.

# 6174 Conjecture:
If you complete these steps for most 4-digit numbers, you will arrive at 6174 and be stuck in a loop.
First, take a number (8615) and order the digits from greatest to least and least to greatest (8651 and 1568).
Second, Subtract these numbers (8651 - 1568 = 7083).
Third, repeat with the new number (8730 - 0378 = 8352) (8532 - 2358 = 6174) (7641 - 1467 = 6174).
